## Description

The Camera object provides animators with the ability to control and manipulate the camera's properties at any frame in the timeline. This allows for dynamic storytelling and enhanced visual effects, similar to techniques used in motion films.

Key features include:

1. Panning to follow the subject within the frame.
2. Zooming in on an object of interest to create a dramatic effect.
3. Zooming out to reveal a broader perspective or context.
4. Adjusting the focal point to shift the viewer's attention between subjects.
5. Rotating the camera to achieve unique angles or perspectives.
6. Applying color tints or filters to enhance the mood or atmosphere of a scene.
