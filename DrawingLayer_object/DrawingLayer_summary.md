## DrawingLayer summary

#### Availability

Flash MX 2004.

#### Description

The DrawingLayer object is accessible from JavaScript as a child of the flash object. The drawingLayer object is used for extensible tools when the user wants to temporarily draw while draggingâ€”for example, when creating a selection marquee. You should call [DrawingLayer.beginFrame()](../DrawingLayer_object/DrawingLayer1.md) before you call any other drawingLayer methods.
