#### Description

## Returns

`string`; A string containing a hexadecimal number that represents the number of seconds that have elapsed between January 1, 1970 and the time the file or folder was last modified, or *"00000000"* if the file doesnâ€™t exist.

## Description

Method; Specifies how many seconds have passed between January 1, 1970 and the time the file or folder was last modified. This method is used primarily to compare the creation or modification dates of files or folders.

## Example

The following example compares the modification dates of two files and determines which of the two was modified more recently:

```javascript
// Make sure the specified files exist.
var file1 = "file:///C|/MyApplication/MyApp.fla";
var file2 = "file:///C|/MyApplication/MyApp.as";
var modificationTime1 = FLfile.getModificationDate(file1);
var modificationTime2 = FLfile.getModificationDate(file2);

if (modificationTime1 > modificationTime2) {
    alert("File 2 is older than File 1");
} else if (modificationTime1 < modificationTime2) {
    alert("File 1 is older than File 2");
} else {
    alert("File 1 and File 2 were saved at the same time");
}
```
