# SymbolInstance.bitmapRenderMode

## Availability

Flash CS5.5 Professional.

## Description

Property; `"none" | "cache" | "export"`; Sets the display type for the symbol. Acceptable values include:

- "none"

- "cache" - Sets the symbol to be cached as a bitmap by Flash Player at runtime.

- "export" - Sets the symbol to be exported as a bitmap when the SWF is compiled.

The older ["SymbolInstance.cacheAsBitmap"](../SymbolInstance_object/SymbolInstance7.md) property is similar to this property, but it offers fewer choices since it's a boolean. In the future, the cacheAsBitmap property may be deprecated, so users should switch to this new property. The true/false options in the boolean cacheAsBitmap property are the same as the "cache" / "none" values for this new property.

## Example

The following example assigns the symbolâ€™s bitmapRenderMode to "export":

```javascript
var symbol = fl.getDocumentDOM().selection[0];
fl.trace(symbol.bitmapRenderMode);
symbol.bitmapRenderMode = "export";
```
